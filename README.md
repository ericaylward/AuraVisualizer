# AuraVisualizer
Early 2016 project for Design Studio 3 (interactive installations).
Uses an Xbox Kinect to read facial expressions and represents it on-screen.

Activate happy: smile big with eyes open widely
Activate sad: frown with eyes open widely
Activate angry: close eyes and open mouth

Background changes based on which user is dominant (has a larger wingspan)
Music changes if both users share the same emotion
Dominant user will change emotion of other user if they're within a certain distance
